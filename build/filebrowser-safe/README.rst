Overview
========

filebrowser_safe was created to provide a snapshot of the 
`FileBrowser asset manager <http://code.google.com/p/django-filebrowser/>`_ 
for `Django <http://www.djangoproject.com/>`_, to be referenced as a 
dependency for the `Mezzanine CMS for Django <http://mezzanine.jupo.org/>`_.

At the time of filebrowser_safe's creation, FileBrowser was incorrectly 
packaged on `PyPI <http://pypi.python.org/pypi>`_, and had also dropped 
compatibility with Django 1.1 - filebrowser_safe was therefore created to 
address these specific issues.

This repository exists for bug fixes and minor enhancements, and 
should some day become redundant, once the original FileBrowser becomes 
a feasibly stable dependency target.
