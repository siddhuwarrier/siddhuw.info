# Agent Instructions

## Read First

Before planning or writing code, read:

1. `docs/spec.md`
2. `docs/ai-rules.md`

These files are the source of truth for product scope and working rules.

## Core Constraints

- Do not write code until the user explicitly asks.
- Stay within current scope from `docs/spec.md`.
- Prefer free and open-source tools and services.
- If requirements are ambiguous, ask one focused clarifying question.

## Working Style

- Start with a brief plan before implementation.
- Make small, reversible changes.
- Preserve existing conventions and unrelated content.
- List changed files and verification results after edits.

## Documentation Updates

- Update `docs/spec.md` when decisions or scope change.
- Add dated decision-log entries for major choices.
