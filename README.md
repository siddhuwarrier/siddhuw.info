#Siddhu's Website

This is the source code for my website. It's hosted on Heroku for absolutely nothing.

## Getting Started

* Clone the github repository
* Set up your environment by executing the following commands (tested on Mac OS X). I assume you have Homebrew installed.

		easy_install pip
		pip install virtualenv
		
* Perform initial setup
		source ./setup_env.sh
		
* Install required dependencies using `pip`
		
		pip install -r requirements.txt
