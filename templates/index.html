                <h2>A developer.</h2>
                <p>I work for the Cloud Platforms Group at <a href="http://www.cisco.com">Cisco</a>  London, and am
                    passionate about Agile, TDD, and Continuous Delivery. </p>

                <h2>A geek.</h2>

                <p> I love Heroku and the Play Framework. I am beginning to appreciate Scala and Cloud Foundry. I play with most of
                    these during a typical work week.</p>

            <div class="span3">
                <h2>A people person.</h2>

                <p> I like people almost as much as I do computers. I find recruitment,
                    developer training and mentoring almost as much fun as I do coding.</p>

                <h2>A wanderer.</h2>

                <p>I gained an education in India, Scotland, and Germany, and have worked in diverse environments in
                    England and Scotland.</p>

                <h2>Once a journalist and blogger.</h2>

                <p>I used to work part-time for an <a href="http://www.rediff.com" target="_blank">Indian news
                    magazine</a>. I used to
                    attempt on a regular basis to write a humorous <a href="http://siddhuw.blogspot.com"

                <h2>A reader.</h2>

                <p>Yes, that sounds clich√©d, but I'm always happiest in the company of Wodehouse, Tagore, Bryson, and
                Conan Doyle. And no, I don't particularly like Douglas Adams. <b>It's my evil twin that likes Lady Gaga, not me!</b></p>
